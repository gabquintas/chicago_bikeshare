## Bike Share Data

This project was part of the Data Science Foundations Nanodegree program from Udacity. I  used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. You will use the data from one of the largest cities of United States: Chicago.

## The Datasets
Data for the first six months of 2017 are provided. The data file contain six (6) columns:

<ul>
<li>Start Time (e.g. 2017-01-01 00:07:57)</li>
<li>End Time (e.g. 2017-01-01 00:20:53)</li>
<li>Trip Duration (in seconds, e.g., 776)</li>
<li>Start Station (e.g. Broadway & Barry Ave)</li>
<li>End Station (e.g. Sedgwick St & North Ave)</li>
<li>User Type (Subscriber or Customer)</li>
<li>Gender (Male or Female)</li>
<li>Birth Year (e.g., 1980)</li>
</ul>

<li>Task 1: Print the first 20 samples(rows) from the database</li>
